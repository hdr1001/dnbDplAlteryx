# dnbDplAlteryx
D&amp;B Direct+ endpoints implemented in Alteryx workflows

## Required
1. for authentication workflow ➡️ environment variables: DnbDplKey & DnbDplSecret for API credentials
2. for other workflows ➡️ environment variables: DnbDplToken

I have not found a way to get around closing and re-starting Alteryx Designer after changing environment variables
